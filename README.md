# email-test-cases 
A collection of e-mail messages with various media types to
test MIME processing.

All e-mails use the same sender and recipient name/address combination. If you
want to really process the e-mails, i.e. send them out then you need to search
and replace the placeholder sender and recipient with your intended sender and
recipient.

The placeholder sender is: `"Test Sender" <sender@email.test>`

The placeholder recipient is: `"Test Recipient" <recipient@email.test>`
